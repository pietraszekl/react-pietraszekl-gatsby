Another re-platforming project from Magento to SAP Hybris.
As a Lead Front-end developer I was involved in every aspect of the project from frontend architecture, code reviews to sprints planing as well as communicating with clients and third party providers to make ensure every one is aligned and the best code quality will be provided. One of the core features that I have developed is so called "Bed Configurator" which allows users to customize they product by selecting size, fabric colour, headboard, storage among other features and be able to instantly preview it and check the price.
