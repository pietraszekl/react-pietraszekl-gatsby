Worked on re-platforming of the Sofa.com from Magento to SAP Hybris. Among various tasks and features I helped to create a "Fabric picker" which enables end-user to quickly browse available samples by colour and fabric type - this feature was developed using VueJS. Other tasks I was involved in were code reviews and setup of the WordPress theme for sofa.com blog.
